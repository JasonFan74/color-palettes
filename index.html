            <p>    We started our color palette design using a computational approach. Given that we were trying to find 8 points in space that are as far apart from one another while still being relatively equidistant, we looked to geometry as a possible realm for a solution. We know that an isosceles triangle is a 2D shape that allows for equally spaced vertices, and a tetrahedron is the 3D equivalent. However, a triangle gives us only 3 points and a tetrahedron only 4 points. Since we are looking for an 8 point shape, a cube was an obvious choice. To recreate a cube in the CIELab color space we chose 2 values each for L*, a*, b*. We then iteratively took all possible combinations of the 3 values and were left with 8 values that mapped to the RBG color space. Image:TODO.                                                                       
        
        <p>    However, the color palette that we produced using the above computational method was not very aesthetically pleasing. To correct this we tried shifting some of the color values around to something that was more visually appealing. This worked relatively well and we were left with the color palette seen below: Image:TODO.</p
        
        <p>    Our color palette now looked a little better but still had a large average distance with a reasonable standard deviation. But, we still weren't completely satisfied with how it looked!</p>
